Haddo!
This endeavor either exists because:

- Puzzles are cool
- Me (inveterate romantic) + You (geeky preferences) = this
- It worked well the first time I tried it, for our second date. Hopefully building this second website will also get you to spend more time with me :)
- Psychology says once people have worked for something, they value it more
- It's easier than creating a Chinese-language K-drama to do the same thing. Or, if you're more of a Burner, ephemeral type, sending a mission to harvest an asteroid, break it up into exactly the right configuration of pieces, and direct it into our atmosphere at exactly the right moment so it spells out my intended message while you watch it burn up in the atmosphere. The puzzle version I settled on seems a bit more in line with your preferences of just getting stuff done.

## The Initial Challenge
We seem to enjoy spending time together outdoors. Many countries in the world have enshrined some of their best outdoor lands into National Parks. By some combination of luck and planning, we've managed to visit a number of these already.

I like the idea of "time spent awestruck and active out in nature together" playing an ongoing role in our partnership. The starting challenge is to list, in the order given by the clues below, the National Parks we have visited.


### Clues
- This park has some of the earliest human artworks we have ever seen- fitting given that we were staying in an ancient village while visiting.
- On our travels, you told me that what humans tried to erect as a barrier, a symbol of oppression spanning an entire continent, animals managed to turn into their own greenway. This NP is the closest NP to that spot.
- What's the only park left? It was divided up into three separate sections.
Where did we do our first snowshoeing adventure together?
- This park is where the clues started, if I recall. I believe I gave you a 'T', for 'Teahouse', after we hiked out to a teahouse, through a decent wash of icy snow, past emerald-green lakes cuddled into the nooks of untains.
- Which park were we closest to during my most memorable Bieber rendition? Incidentally, this is probably our position with the lowest concentration of humans within both 100 and 1000 miles radius.
- Which park has a landing strip, or an airport, for angels?
Which park is most emblematic of the philosophy 'The best park is the one you visit', just like 'The best bike is the bike you ride'?
- Which park have we climbed at the most? It is also, by many measures, our most-visited-park period, and one of our most enjoyed parks.
- Frankly, I don't remember much about this park in particular, because it was squashed in between robots and Civ and the utterly mesmerizing Lake Louise and some sickness. You might even say that I blanked on it, or at I 'spaced' out about it. In fact, that is exactly what I would do if I were at your keyboard.

- Our adventure in which park best conveys our approach of 'choosing to enjoy the journey, even if we don't end up in the expected destination', or 'finding the heart of the matter, and making that the goal', or hoosing to find joy wherever possible'.
- We've visited two countries where we(I?) have fallen in love with fjords. One of those countries we only visited a single NP, because the random day hikes nearby were even more stunning and serene and peaceful and expected and post-holey and batcave-y than we could ever hope to expect from a park.
- Which park that we have been to has the meltiest name?
- Which park that we have visited had the most mismatched name to what it currently was?
- Which park had an arch that proved you can still stay structurally sound, even as some more decorative elements collapse?
- Which park did we visit that was centered near a feisty volcano that erupted within the past few years?
Which park is closest to where we got swept away by the serence peace and beauty of tea plantations, were warned to be vigilant against roving bands of bandit babboons, ran through a veritable hail of babboon-bombed lling shells, and saw fruits as large as a human child?
- This is where worshippers from at least 3 religions are competing to be the first revived for the afterlife, when God returns to Earth. This is not where I want us buried after we live to at least 101.
- Of all the National Parks we have climbed in, where have we climbed the hardest grade?
- Which park had perilous and Seussian features like sand castles that had been glooped onto the landscape by a playful giant?
- Which park hosts our most-frequently-told story of pain and suffering?
- Our adventure in which park best symbolizes how we choose to give each other credit as frequently as possible, even if it might not always be strictly deserved...
